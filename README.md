# Python-Project-Real-time-sign-language-detection-using-googles-mediapipe
In this project we shall develop a real-time on-device hand tracking solution which predicts a hand skeleton of a human using a single RGB camera.

Sign Language is the most common mode of communication amongst the deaf and mute people. Many communities don't even try to learn it even though it is the most popular form of communication for a deaf and mute person It end up creating an isolation for physically disabled people. This problem calls for a system which can comprehend physical hand gestures based on static movements and bridge the communication between the normal and disabled.

Sign language is just making use of gestures instead of sound to convey meaning, simultaneously combining hand shapes, orientations and movement of the hands, arms or body and facial expressions to express a speakerâ€™s thoughts. 

In this project we shall develop a real-time on-device hand tracking solution which predicts a hand skeleton of a human using a single RGB camera. 
This project focuses on developing an algorithm for recognition of hand gestures with reasonable accuracy, where the input to the pattern recognition system will be given from the hand. 

It recognizes the pattern and displays the pattern in the form of the text. 
Here we are making use of Mediapipe library provided by google which is open-source and it is a well-trained model to achieve high performance. 
With the help of models of Mediapipe library, Gestures of a hand can be determined using different technologies. 
So here are some signs that we have developed with our algorithm Such as Hello,Goodbye,yes,no,agree,disagree,not sure,directions-left,right,piece 
Here is a project Output you can see in the video
